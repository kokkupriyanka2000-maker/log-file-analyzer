# Log File Analyzer (Python)

## 📌 Overview
This project is a command-line based Log File Analyzer developed using Python.
It helps software engineers analyze application log files by counting and filtering
log levels such as **INFO**, **WARNING**, and **ERROR**.

This tool simulates a real-world debugging utility used during software development
and production support.
